    <h2>Sun</h2>
    <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, <br>with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by <br>far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.</p>

    <h2>Planets</h2>
    <h3>Mercury</h3>
    <p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. It has no natural satellites and <br> no substantial atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Venus</h3>
    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is similar in size to Earth, and often called Earth's "sister <br> planet", but it has a dense, toxic atmosphere.</p>

    <h3>Earth</h3>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. <br>It has one natural satellite, the Moon.</p>

    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System after <br>Mercury. It is often called the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance.</p>

    <h3>Jupiter</h3>
    <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth that of <br>the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined.</p>

    <h3>Saturn</h3>
    <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. <br> It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth.</p>

    <h3>Uranus</h3>
    <p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant, the third-largest in the Solar System, <br>and the fourth-largest by planetary mass.</p>

    <h3>Neptune</h3>
    <p>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. It is a gas giant, similar in <br>composition to Uranus.</p>

    <h2>Other Objects</h2>
    <h3>Moons</h3>
    <p>Many planets in the Solar System have moons, also known as natural satellites. For example, <br> Earth has one moon, while Jupiter has over 70.</p>

    <h3>Asteroids</h3>
    <p>Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun. They are typically found in the asteroid <br>belt, between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p>

    <h3>Comets</h3>
    <p id="down">Comets are icy bodies that orbit the Sun. They are often described as "dirty snowballs" because <br>they are composed of ice, dust, and rocky material.</p>
